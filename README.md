# **Decorator example (esy to understand)**
    From my knowledge the decorators are wrapper used to modify behavior of a function mainly
    by addibg code before and/or after the decorated function or modify the arguments passed
    to it. They contain a inner funtion that wrap around the decorated function and can be executed
    before or after the decorated function is called

# **Description:**
    The purpose of the script is to provide a simple example of how decorators work and to make their understanding easier.
    This a simple example with comments that follow all exeution steps in the first part. 
    The second part is exactly the same script but using "@" to define hello_decorator(func) as a decorator to 
    function_to_be_used() 

# **Running:**
